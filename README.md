# BeeFIT – Fitness Website Project

BeeFIT is a full–year collaboration project created as a high school graduation project together with my classmate.  
The goal was to design and develop a **modern, responsive, and SEO–optimized website** for a Prague-based fitness center.  

The project involved the complete process — from initial meetings with the client, wireframes and design proposals, all the way through to development, accessibility testing, optimization, and deployment.

## Overview

### The challenge

The main challenge was to create a **modern and maintainable website** for a real client, while ensuring:

- Responsive design across devices
- SEO optimization and performance improvements
- Accessibility support
- A custom CMS for the client to easily manage content
- Deployment on the client’s hosting

## My process

### Built with

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) – Frontend framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Fast development build tool
- [MeltUI](https://melt-ui.com/) – UI components for Svelte
- [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) – Headless CMS
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) & [Český hosting](https://www.cesky-hosting.cz/) – Deployment
- Lighthouse & WAVE – Testing accessibility, SEO, and performance

### What I learned

- How to work on a **long-term project** with continuous client feedback  
- Setting up and integrating a **headless CMS** with Svelte frontend  
- Best practices for **SEO optimization and accessibility** (using Lighthouse, WAVE)  
- Full deployment workflow (Netlify + custom hosting)  

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to:

- Refine CMS integration with even more flexibility for the client  
- Further improve performance scores and accessibility features  
- Explore adding animations while respecting reduced motion preferences  
- Finalize deployment by moving from the test domain to the client’s official domain
